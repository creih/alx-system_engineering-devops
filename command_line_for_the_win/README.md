this is the task about shell skills

Steps I used for the sftp:
1. went to <get a sand box from intranet>
2. copy pasted into my terminal the copied sftp link
3. I was requested for comfirmation from my bash terminal along with password of sftp server
4. typed put "put 0-first_9_tasks.png 1-next_9_tasks.png" and checked with ls if the files had been uploaded
